            | If elsewhere someone adds:
            .c-code
              | span div ul {
              br
              | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¦
              br
              | }
            | it can change the ul we defined previously. So what exactly are we defining with plain CSS rules?
          li.c-list__element

              | There's no strict control
